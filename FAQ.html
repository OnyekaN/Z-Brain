        <h1>The fish I want to register are not 6 dpf, can I still
	register them to the Z-Brain?</h1>
	<p>If the fish are not of the correct stage (6dpf), you
	certainly can still run the registration and attempt to align
	them to the atlas. But, since the fish brain is rapidly
	growing and maturing at these stages, there will be substantial
	differences in anatomy between stages. So we would recommend
	that you stick with the 6dpf stage, and we will not include
	any non-6dpf data in the Z-Brain database.</p>
        <br><br>	
        <h1>My fish are not in the Nacre background, can I use PTU
	instead to prevent pigment formation?</h1>
	<p>You can do this, but PTU causes artifacts like delayed
	development and altered behaviour. So we would only like to
	use this as a last resort. An alternative is to bleach
	pigmented fish. Using 3%H2O2, 1%KOH in water for 20-30min
	after the PFA fixation step can efficiently clear the melanin
	pigment. But, this bleaching can also destroy antigens and
	worsen staining (see for example <a
	href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040132"
	target="_blank">Li et al., 2012, Plos One</a>).
	The ERK signal survives bleaching well, and so we would
	recommend bleaching over PTU, if your other stains are
	compatible.</p>
	<br><br>
        <h1>We like to take our stacks of fish live, rather than
	fixing and staining with ERK. Can we use a live-marker for
	registration?</h1>
	<p>Yes, in theory you can use any of the labels already
	contained in the Z-Brain as your registration channel. This
	includes multiple transgenes that can be imaged live. Or, if
	have a workhorse counter stain/line that you like to use, you
	can first incorporate this into the atlas by fixing some fish
	of this line, stain for ERK, and then register this stain into
	the atlas using ERK. You can use this newly registered line
	for your subsequent live-imaging registrations. Keeping in
	mind that registering to the Z-Brain via this indirect path
	(ie not registering directly to the original ERK brain), will
	not be as optimal as direct 1-step registration using the
	original stain.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h1>What is the catalog number for the ERK antibody?</h1>
	<p>anti-ERK (p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (L34F12) Mouse mAb #4696,
	<a href="http://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/4696"
	target="_blank">http://www.cellsignal.com/products/primary-antibodies/4696</a>)</p>
	<br><br>
	<h1>The Z-Brain Viewer isn’t working. What might be wrong?</h1>
	<p>Make sure you have the AnatomyLabelDatabase.hdf5, and
	MaskDatabase.mat file, that you are running a recent version
	of Matlab (post R2014a), and have the image processing
	toolbox. If this still isn’t working, please email me and send
	me any error messages you see.</p>
	<br><br>
	<h1>What is the image resolution of the Z-Brain?</h1>
	<p>The image resolution is the same as the reference brain. It
	is x/y/z = 0.798/0.798/2 um.</p>
